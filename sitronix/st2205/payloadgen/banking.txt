--------

Register pair 0x34/0x35 controls the area at 0x8000 - 0xffff:

0x35 is 0: it points to flash
0x35 is 1: it points to 0xff (unattached)
0x35 is 2: it points to 0xff (unattached)
0x35 is 3: it points to lcd controller

for the case that 0x35 == 0, 0x34 controls which page is mapped:

0x34 == 0: area points to firmware bank at offset 0
0x34 == 1: area points to firmware bank at offset 0x8000

0x34 == 2: area points to flash image memory bank at offset 0
0x34 == 3: area points to flash image memory bank at offset 0x8000
.
.
.
0x34 == X: area points to flash image memory bank at offset (x-2)*0x8000

it wraps around after 0x34 == 0x40, which corresponds to 0x34 == 0


-------

Register pair 0x30/0x31 controls the area at 0x4000 - 0x7fff:

0x31 is 0: area points to flash
0x31 != 0: area points to 0xff (unattached?)
0x31 is 6: perhaps points to lcd controller, not sure

when 0x31 == 0, 0x32 controls the page mapping:

0x30 == 0 : area points to firmware bank at offset 0
0x30 == 1 : area points to firmware bank at offset 0x4000
0x30 == 2 : area points to firmware bank at offset 0x8000
0x30 == 3 : area points to firmware bank at offset 0xC000

0x30 == 4 : area points to flash image memory bank at offset 0
0x30 == 5 : area points to flash image memory bank at offset 0x4000
.
.
.
0x30 == x : area points to flash image memory bank at offset (x-4)*0x4000
